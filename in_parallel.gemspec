  spec.description   = "The other Ruby librarys that do parallel execution all support one primary use case " +
      "- crunching through a large queue of small tasks as quickly and efficiently as possible. This library " +
      "primarily supports the use case of needing to run a few larger tasks in parallel and managing the " +
      "stdout to make it easy to understand which processes are logging what. This library was created to be " +
      "used by the Beaker test framework to enable parallel execution of some of the framework's tasks, and " +
      "allow people within thier tests to execute code in parallel when wanted. This solution does not check " +
      "to see how many processors you have, it just forks as many processes as you ask for. That means that it " +
      "will handle a handful of parallel processes well, but could definitely overload your system with ruby " +
      "processes if you try to spin up a LOT of processes. If you're looking for something simple and " +
      "light-weight and on either linux or mac (forking processes is not supported on Windows), then this " +
      "solution could be what you want."
